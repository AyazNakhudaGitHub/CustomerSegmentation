# CustomerSegmentation

The work done in this project is based on a dataset from Kaggle that provides details on purchases made by British customers on an e-commerce platform. I have developed a classifier which allows for the anticipation of the type of purchase that a customer will make along with the number of visits that they will make during a year, based on their first visit. 87% of the customers were given the correct classification. I learned how to implement ensemble learning using the Scikit-Learn library.
